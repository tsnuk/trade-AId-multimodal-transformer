    """
    Calculates success rate (based on predicting the correct direction of change for numeric data)
    and certainty (confidence in the prediction) for each modality from evaluation logits and targets.

    This function processes the output of the model (logits) and the actual target values (yb)
    for a given batch during evaluation. It iterates through each modality and, for numeric data,
    determines if the model's prediction for the last token in a sequence correctly predicted
    the direction of change compared to the previous token.

    For the success rate calculation, *any* predicted direction (up, down, or flat) is compared
    against the actual direction. Wins are counted when the predicted direction matches the
    actual direction (e.g., both up, both down, or both flat). Losses are counted when they do not match.

    The certainty metric represents the model's confidence in the predicted *direction* of change for
    the last token. It is calculated by summing the probabilities (from the softmax of the last token's
    logits) of all possible next tokens that fall within the same direction (up, down, or flat) as the
    single token with the highest predicted probability.

    For applications like stock price prediction, accurately forecasting the direction of movement can
    be highly beneficial, as predicting the exact next price can be significantly more challenging and
    isn't always necessary.

    Note that unusually high directional certainty rates may occur, especially in early training stages
    or with certain data distributions, even if the overall success rate is near chance. This indicates
    the model is strongly skewed towards predicting a particular direction, regardless of accuracy.

    These directional metrics provide additional insights into the model's behavior during evaluation.
    The model's learning process, however, is driven solely by minimizing the calculated loss.

    The function accumulates these metrics across the batch and reports the results for each modality.

    Args:
        logits_list: A list of tensors, one for each modality, containing the logits
                     for each token in the batch. Shape: List of [(batch_size, block_size, vocab_size)]

        all_modality_params: A list of ModalityConfig instances, one for each processed modality.

        batch_size: The number of sequences processed in parallel in each batch. (int)

  Converts numeric data to a specified range by scaling them by factors of 10

                  The data may contain values that are positive, zero, or negative.
                  (zero, or negative values could be expected with data types like percentages).
    modality_params: A ModalityConfig instance (used primarily for accessing modality_name for printing).
    num_whole_digits: The desired number of whole digits for the ranged prices
                      (e.g., 1 for ones, 2 for tens, etc.). Must be an integer or None (default: None).

    """
    Calculates success rate (based on predicting the correct direction of change for numeric data)
    and certainty (confidence in the prediction) for each modality from evaluation logits and targets.

    This function processes the output of the model (logits) and the actual target values (yb)
    for a given batch during evaluation. It iterates through each modality and, for numeric data,
    determines if the model's prediction for the last token in a sequence correctly predicted
    the direction of change compared to the previous token.

    For the success rate calculation, *any* predicted direction (up, down, or flat) is compared
    against the actual direction. Wins are counted when the predicted direction matches the
    actual direction (e.g., both up, both down, or both flat). Losses are counted when they do not match.

    The certainty metric represents the model's confidence in the predicted *direction* of change for
    the last token. It is calculated by summing the probabilities (from the softmax of the last token's
    logits) of all possible next tokens that fall within the same direction (up, down, or flat) as the
    single token with the highest predicted probability.

    For applications like stock price prediction, accurately forecasting the direction of movement can
    be highly beneficial, as predicting the exact next price can be significantly more challenging and
    isn't always necessary.

    Note that unusually high directional certainty rates may occur, especially in early training stages
    or with certain data distributions, even if the overall success rate is near chance. This indicates
    the model is strongly skewed towards predicting a particular direction, regardless of accuracy.

    These directional metrics provide additional insights into the model's behavior during evaluation.
    The model's learning process, however, is driven solely by minimizing the calculated loss.

    The function accumulates these metrics across the batch and reports the results for each modality.

    In essence, the training steps above represent a single training iteration where the model:
        1. Receives data,
        2. Makes predictions,
        3. Calculates the error,
        4. Determines how to adjust its parameters to reduce the error, and
        5. Applies those adjustments.
    line 1: gets a batch of training data (get_batch), in the form of input sequences (xb) and their corresponding target outputs (yb)
            these batches are used to train the model in small increments, making the process more efficient and manageable
    line 2: passes the data through the model to get predictions and calculate the loss
            logits_list, losses_list = m(xb_list, yb_list) # Updated to use 'm'
            logits are the model's raw predictions before any final activation function is applied (like softmax for classification)
            the code also calculates a loss value. This loss quantities how far off the model's predictions (logits) are from the actual target values (yb)
    line 3: this line resets any previously calculated gradients to zero
            optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
    line 4: this line initiates the backpropagation process. It calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to all the model's trainable parameters
            total_loss.backward() # Backpropagate the combined loss
            (in simpler terms, it figures out how much each parameter contributed to the error (loss) and in which direction the parameter should be adjusted to reduce the error)
    line 5: this line updates the model's parameters using the optimizer to minimize the loss
            optimizer.step()
            the optimizer (AdamW) takes a step towards minimizing the loss by adjusting the parameters in the direction indicated by the gradients

    """
    Calculates success rate (based on predicting the correct direction of change for numeric data)
    and certainty (confidence in the prediction) for each modality from evaluation logits and targets.

    This function processes the output of the model (logits) and the actual target values (yb)
    for a given batch during evaluation. It iterates through each modality and, for numeric data,
    determines if the model's prediction for the last token in a sequence correctly predicted
    the direction of change compared to the previous token.

    For the success rate calculation, *any* predicted direction (up, down, or flat) is compared
    against the actual direction. Wins are counted when the predicted direction matches the
    actual direction (e.g., both up, both down, or both flat). Losses are counted when they do not match.

    The certainty metric represents the model's confidence in the predicted *direction* of change for
    the last token. It is calculated by summing the probabilities (from the softmax of the last token's
    logits) of all possible next tokens that fall within the same direction (up, down, or flat) as the
    single token with the highest predicted probability.

    For applications like stock price prediction, accurately forecasting the direction of movement can
    be highly beneficial, as predicting the exact next price can be significantly more challenging and
    isn't always necessary.

    Note that unusually high directional certainty rates may occur, especially in early training stages
    or with certain data distributions, even if the overall success rate is near chance. This indicates
    the model is strongly skewed towards predicting a particular direction, regardless of accuracy.

    These directional metrics provide additional insights into the model's behavior during evaluation.
    The model's learning process, however, is driven solely by minimizing the calculated loss.

    The function accumulates these metrics across the batch and reports the results for each modality.

# --- Model Creation and Loading ---
#
# The 'create_new_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# a new model is created or a previously saved one is loaded.
# Set create_new_model = 1 to create a new model and start training from scratch.
# Set create_new_model = 0 to attempt to load a model from model_file_name.
#
# The 'model_file_name' variable (defined in a settings cell) specifies the path
# to save the model to, or load the model from. Ensure this path is correct.
#
# IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN LOADING A MODEL (create_new_model = 0):
# The code assumes that the data loading and processing steps executed
# BEFORE attempting to load the model generate the *same* vocabulary
# and that the hyperparameters (like n_embd, n_head, n_layer, block_size,
# num_modalities) match those of the saved model.
# If the data, vocabulary, or hyperparameters change between saving and loading,
# the loaded model might not work correctly with the current data or evaluation
# logic and could produce nonsensical results.

# --- Model Saving ---
#
# The 'save_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# the model's parameters are saved during and after training.
# Set save_model = 1 to save the model periodically during training (at eval_interval)
# and at the end of training.
# Set save_model = 0 to disable model saving for this training run.
#
# When save_model = 1, the model will be saved to the path specified by
# 'model_file_name'.

"""## Directional Metrics Explained

Directional metrics (success rate and certainty) are calculated in the `calculate_evaluation_metrics` function to assess how well the model predicts the *direction* of change for numeric data, particularly the last token in a sequence, which is relevant for tasks like predicting stock price movements.

**Applicability:** These metrics are calculated *only* for modalities where the data is numeric and the sequence length is sufficient (at least 1 for percentage changes, at least 2 for value changes).

**Success Rate:**
*   For each batch during evaluation, the function looks at the model's predicted token (based on the highest logit) and the actual target token for the *last* position in the sequence.
*   It then determines the "direction" of change for both the predicted and actual values. This direction is based on:
    *   **For Percentage Data:** Whether the value is positive (up), negative (down), or zero (flat).
    *   **For Value Data:** Whether the current value is greater than (up), less than (down), or equal to (flat) the *previous* value in the sequence.
*   A "win" is counted if the predicted direction matches the actual direction (e.g., both predicted and actual are "up," or both are "down," or both are "flat").
*   A "loss" is counted if the predicted direction does not match the actual direction.
*   These wins and losses are accumulated across all evaluation batches for each applicable modality.
*   The overall directional success rate is reported as the total wins divided by the total movements counted (wins + losses), expressed as a percentage.

**Directional Certainty:**
*   This metric measures the model's confidence in the predicted *direction* for the last token in a sequence.
*   For the last token's logits, a softmax function is applied to get the probability distribution over the entire vocabulary for that modality.
*   The predicted direction is determined based on the token with the highest probability (as in the success rate calculation).
*   The certainty for that prediction is calculated by summing the probabilities of *all* tokens in the vocabulary that fall within that *same predicted direction*.
*   For example, if the model predicts an "up" movement (based on the highest probability token), the directional certainty will be the sum of probabilities for *all* positive values in the vocabulary for percentage data, or the sum of probabilities for all values greater than the previous value for value data.
*   This sum of probabilities is accumulated across all evaluation batches for each applicable modality.
*   The overall average directional certainty is reported as the total accumulated certainty divided by the total number of predictions made (number of evaluation batches \* batch size).

In summary, the success rate tells you how often the model's predicted direction matches the actual direction, while the directional certainty tells you how confident the model is in its predicted direction (by summing probabilities of all outcomes that align with that direction). These metrics are calculated specifically for numeric modalities during the evaluation phase.

I also need to update `report_non_numeric_error`, `calculate_evaluation_metrics`, `range_numeric_data`, `bin_numeric_data`, and `calculate_percent_changes` to handle modality parameters as dictionaries from `all_modality_params`. Finally, I need to update the training loop and initial run details writing in cell `ASVC7cZnHICM` to access modality parameters using dictionary keys from `all_modality_params`.

**Reasoning**:
I need to update the `estimate_loss` function and the initial run details writing section in cell `ASVC7cZnHICM` to access modality parameters from the `all_modality_params` list using dictionary keys.

# --- Model Creation and Loading ---
#
# The 'create_new_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# a new model is created or a previously saved one is loaded.
# Set create_new_model = 1 to create a new model and start training from scratch.
# Set create_new_model = 0 to attempt to load a model from model_file_name.
#
# The 'model_file_name' variable (defined in a settings cell) specifies the path
# to save the model to, or load the model from. Ensure this path is correct.
#
# IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN LOADING A MODEL (create_new_model = 0):
# The code assumes that the data loading and processing steps executed
# BEFORE attempting to load the model generate the *same* vocabulary
# and that the hyperparameters (like n_embd, n_head, n_layer, block_size,
# num_modalities) match those of the saved model.
# If the data, vocabulary, or hyperparameters change between saving and loading,
# the loaded model might not work correctly with the current data or evaluation
# logic and could produce nonsensical results.

# --- Model Saving ---
#
# The 'save_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# the model's parameters are saved during and after training.
# Set save_model = 1 to save the model periodically during training (at eval_interval)
# and at the end of training.
# Set save_model = 0 to disable model saving for this training run.

        4. Determines how to adjust its parameters to reduce the error, and

    line 1: gets a batch of training data (get_batch), in the form of input sequences (xb) and their corresponding target outputs (yb)
            these batches are used to train the model in small increments, making the process more efficient and manageable

            logits are the model's raw predictions before any final activation function is applied (like softmax for classification)
            the code also calculates a loss value. This loss quantities how far off the model's predictions (logits) are from the actual target values (yb)
    line 3: this line resets any previously calculated gradients to zero
            optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)

    line 5: this line updates the model's parameters using the calculated gradients

The traceback indicates an `IndexError` in the `MultimodalBlock` constructor, specifically when trying to access `all_modality_params[i][3]`.

The traceback indicates that the loaded `config_data` does not contain a list under the key 'modalities'.

I need to modify the YAML generation in cell `6c4564c5` to include the 'modalities' section with the modality configurations, which should now be defined using the `ModalityConfig` data class. I will also update the instantiation of `ModalityConfig` in the data loading cell `b92c0d1f` to use the updated data class definition.

'''
The MultimodalTransformer class performs the following operations:
1. MultimodalPreBlock: Prepares input from multiple modalities by converting them into embeddings and adding positional information.
2. MultimodalBlocks: These are the core processing units. Each block performs self-attention within each modality and selective cross-attention between specified modalities.
3. forward: Defines the entire multimodal transformer process.
4. generate: Is used to generate new tokens for a specified modality based on the context from all modalities.

# --- Model Creation and Loading ---
#
# The 'create_new_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# a new model is created or a previously saved one is loaded.
# Set create_new_model = 1 to create a new model and start training from scratch.
# Set create_new_model = 0 to attempt to load a model from model_file_name.
#
# The 'model_file_name' variable (defined in a settings cell) specifies the path
# to save the model to, or load the model from. Ensure this path is correct.
#
# IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN LOADING A MODEL (create_new_model = 0):
# The code assumes that the data loading and processing steps executed
# BEFORE attempting to load the model generate the *same* vocabulary
# and that the hyperparameters (like n_embd, n_head, n_layer, block_size,
# num_modalities) match those of the saved model.
# If the data, vocabulary, or hyperparameters change between saving and loading,
# the loaded model might not work correctly with the current data or evaluation
# logic and could produce nonsensical results.

# --- Model Saving ---
#
# The 'save_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# the model's parameters are saved during and after training.
# Set save_model = 1 to save the model periodically during training (at eval_interval)
# and at the end of training.
# Set save_model = 0 to disable model saving for this training run.
#
# When save_model = 1, the model will be saved to the path specified by
# 'model_file_name'.

    In essence, the training steps above represent a single training iteration where the model:
        1. Receives data,
        2. Makes predictions,
        3. Calculates the error,
        4. Determines how to adjust its parameters to reduce the error, and
        5. Applies those adjustments.
    line 1: gets a batch of training data (get_batch), in the form of input sequences (xb) and their corresponding target outputs (yb)
            these batches are used to train the model in small increments, making the process more efficient and manageable
    line 2: passes the data through the model to get predictions and calculate the loss
            logits_list, losses_list = m(xb_list, yb_list) # Updated to use 'm'
            logits are the model's raw predictions before any final activation function is applied (like softmax for classification)
            the code also calculates a loss value. This loss quantities how far off the model's predictions (logits) are from the actual target values (yb)
    line 3: this line resets any previously calculated gradients to zero
            optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)
    line 4: this line initiates the backpropagation process. It calculates the gradients of the loss with respect to all the model's trainable parameters
            total_loss.backward() # Backpropagate the combined loss
            (in simpler terms, it figures out how much each parameter contributed to the error (loss) and in which direction the parameter should be adjusted to reduce the error)
    line 5: this line updates the model's parameters using the optimizer to minimize the loss
            optimizer.step()
            the optimizer (AdamW) takes a step towards minimizing the loss by adjusting the parameters in the direction indicated by the gradients

"""**Reasoning**:
The traceback shows a `NameError` because `MultiHeadAttention` is not defined. This indicates that the cell containing the definition of the `MultiHeadAttention` class (and likely other related model components like `Head`, `CrossAttention`, `FeedForward`, `MultimodalPreBlock`, `MultimodalPostBlock`, and `MultimodalTransformer`) was not executed or is in a cell that is ordered after the cell trying to instantiate the model. I need to execute the cell containing the model definitions (cell `GPP9cM9Qftga`) to define these classes before the model is instantiated in cell `ASVC7cZnHICM`.

# No new code is needed in this response, just ensuring the cell is executed.

"""**Reasoning**:
The `MultiHeadAttention` class and other model components should now be defined after executing cell `GPP9cM9Qftga`. I can now attempt to execute the code in cell `ASVC7cZnHICM` again, which instantiates and trains the model. This should resolve the `NameError` and proceed with model loading or creation and then the training loop.

# --- Model Creation and Loading ---
#
# The 'create_new_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# a new model is created or a previously saved one is loaded.
# Set create_new_model = 1 to create a new model and start training from scratch.
# Set create_new_model = 0 to attempt to load a model from model_file_name.
#
# The 'model_file_name' variable (defined in a settings cell) specifies the path
# to save the model to, or load the model from. Ensure this path is correct.
#
# IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WHEN LOADING A MODEL (create_new_model = 0):
# The code assumes that the data loading and processing steps executed
# BEFORE attempting to load the model generate the *same* vocabulary
# and that the hyperparameters (like n_embd, n_head, n_layer, block_size,
# num_modalities) match those of the saved model.
# If the data, vocabulary, or hyperparameters change between saving and loading,
# the loaded model might not work correctly with the current data or evaluation
# logic and could produce nonsensical results.

# --- Model Saving ---
#
# The 'save_model' variable (defined in a settings cell) controls whether
# the model's parameters are saved during and after training.
# Set save_model = 1 to save the model periodically during training (at eval_interval)
# and at the end of training.
# Set save_model = 0 to disable model saving for this training run.

"""**Reasoning**:
The traceback indicates that `MultiHeadAttention` is still not defined, even after attempting to implicitly execute the cell containing its definition. This suggests an issue with the execution order or state. To guarantee that the model components are defined before the model is instantiated, I will explicitly include the code from cell `GPP9cM9Qftga` which defines the model architecture, immediately before the model instantiation code in cell `ASVC7cZnHICM`.

## Update parameter loading

### Subtask:
Update parameter loading from the YAML file.

**Reasoning**:
The previous attempt failed with an `IndexError` in the `MultimodalBlock` constructor because it was trying to access elements in `all_modality_params` using an index `i` that was out of the list's bounds. This suggests a mismatch between `num_modalities` and the length of `all_modality_params`. The `MultimodalTransformer` and `MultimodalBlock` constructors are now expecting a `List[ModalityConfig]`, but `all_modality_params` is being populated with dictionaries in cell `b92c0d1f`. I need to update cell `b92c0d1f` to populate `all_modality_params` with `ModalityConfig` instances instead of dictionaries.
